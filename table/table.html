								I would certainly take some form of action. Bullying or harassment should never be tolerated in the workplace. I would make sure that the actions is in violation of company policy before taking official action. However, in the moment, I would do all that I could to stop what I feel is inappropriate behavior. That could include telling both parties that I feel that the situation is inappropriate for the workplace, or even inform a senior manager or HR. My goal wouldn't be to seem confrontational and escalate the situation, but to make sure that the 'bully' is aware that someone thinks that what they are doing is wrong, and the  bully know that they have support in case they want to speak up.

							</br></br>I have been in a position with Leidos when a person was making inappropriate remarks of a sexual nature at work in front of a female co-worker. I could tell that it was said as a joke, but the comment was made to tell the female that he would be open to a similar work encounter. The female laughed it off, but I said 'be careful or you're going to catch a harassment case'. I said it half-jokingly with the hopes that I wouldn't escalate anything, but at the same time point out that his statement could be taken as an offense.

								No I have never been in that position. I am always very careful about the jobs that I apply for and accept. I don’t believe it would be fair on either myself or the company I was applying to join if I accepted a job that wasn’t right for me. 
								For instance, I know that this job is the right one for me. I have carried out extensive research into this role and have even sought out testimonials from people that have worked in a this or a similar role.

							</br></br>The closest scenario would be my role with NVTC. I was informed during the interview process that the role would include software development. Initially there was development, however, later that year the role turned more towards operational support and COTS and GOTS research. During the following periodic reviews, I was able to work with the customer to craft my future goals and objectives towards delivering impact through more engineering, development, and cloud work. After the customer saw the impact that I could make, more desired tasks would come.

								NVTC Lilt Design Review: With the work program ending, other partner organizations were ready to call the product a success and work to acquire it. I completed GovCloud installation, configuration, and alpha testing. My conclusion was that the product would need extensive updates to fix bugs and to make the product work within our environment. My supervisor was concerned with the approaching deadline and didn't think there was anything that we could do; either acquire or not. I requested a meeting to explain our needs to the vendor. The agency CIO attended the meeting. After explaining our needs and why, the vendor agreed that the updates should be made. The agency CIO also felt that the updates would be impactful and acquired additional funds to extend the work program to give the vendor an opportunity to justify supplanting our current operational tools. The vendor was able to make the updates and now is under greater consideration for acquisition, rather than making the two years in the work program a waste of time.  The government lead and my supervisor thanked me for my persistence and driving that outcome.

The change to this ID format would break the current inflexible delivery pipeline.  
							</br>I was asked if I could reverse engineer this MS Access DB to the new format, fix the bugs and update the code to handle the customer's newly mandated identification format. Due to the tight deadline and rather than spending ample time on refactoring an outdated legacy system, I highlighted the few key points within the delivery process needed to meet busines goals, and offered a simpler solution using a technology that was already well supported within the office and easier to maintain. 
							</br>Using a few lines of Powershell code for incoming and outgoing deliveries, I was able to implement and test the solution within a couple of weeks, allowing NVTC to continue receiving and processing jobs from this customer after their mandated identifier change. 

							</br></br>NVTC - Pilot (GroupShare vs. WorldServer; Lilt vs. SDL) Decision Analysis: During product evaluations and comparisons, there are a lot of factors to consider both quantitative and qualitative. Given product similarities, the team was initially summarizing their recommendations but couldn't come to a consensus for which was better. I created an Excel spreadsheet that help to objectify the process and recommend a product given weighted averages. The team would rate feature importance and rate how well each product performed each feature/service; along with quick notes the team members rating. The team then reviewed the ratings collectively and created a team rating to come to a consensus.

								Graham IR&D OD Insights AI: Within our quest to demonstrate and provide solutions for our customers, we faced challenges to access of sensitive health care related data. To deliver the solution, I worked with our data scientists to research and stitch together data sets of similar types to those that were unavailable from reports and whitepapers, so that we could offer realistic feature innovation. This feature was one of the most impressive features that lead to furthering our business relationships. 

								</br></br>During my Amazon interview I could recall resume level detail but hadn't been capturing leadership opportunities as well as I should have. So, although I didn't get the job, I systematically laid out key projects going as far back as I could remember and captured leadership opportunities within the STAR format. This was great because I'm not only better prepared to express my worth to a company and how I'd handle certain situations, but this exercise has also helped me adopt a few more core values that I now strive to achieve while searching for these opportunities day-to-day.

								Leidos to Graham: Transitioning from Leidos to Graham was a calculated risk. I was highly favored with Leidos and after six year of stellar service, I had moved into leadership positions and could have continued to progress up the chain of command. With Graham, I knew that I'd be starting over with an organization that was unfamiliar. In addition, although Graham had been around for 7 years and had somewhat established itself, I would be moving on from a well-established organization to one that had just began to blossom. However, I saw the potential in Graham and my prospects for climbing the corporate ladder. I'm blessed to have made that move and now look to take advantage of a similar move here with [Professional Services] role at Amazon.

However, at times, I do take calculated risk such as undertaking Graham's health care solution - OD Insights - without any health care SME.

								I believe in the modern-world we need to make more effective use of outsourcers to complete specific tasks, and that is what I would do if I had a difficult project to coordinate which had a tight budget and limited resources. I recently took this approach when my team was overloaded with high priority tasks, yet we had another high priority task that needed to be implemented within a couple of weeks in preparation for a customer meeting. Our best front-end developer was occupied, so I outsourced the work to a partner firm for which we'd had a previous relationship. I presented requirements and got the ball rolling by designing and implementing the static portions of our web site before allowing our in-house developers to integrate the solution within our application and add dynamic features to meet the deadline. 

							</br></br>I would start by adequately communicating expectations to the customer without stating that I cannot do it. I would attack the problem using Agile principles to ensure that we'd be able to deliver value in increments until the full business goal was achieved.

								</br>One time comes to mind when I was helping a non-technologically savvy user use a human language technology product. The user had received one-on-one training several times, but the concepts to using the tool weren't setting in like it was for the other linguists. I showed him patients with him and ensure that he was able to produce translations using the tool. The user was embarrassed to continue to ask for help, but I took it upon myself to reassure him that asking was okay and that he would get it eventually. In addition to talking him through the steps, I worked with him to create and document new customized steps using his terms and only highlighting key features. Finding terminology that he was familiar with and simplifying the process did the trick. The user was very incredibly grateful and thankful for the extra assistance and went on to be one of our biggest champions of the software.

								NVTC Lilt: New team lead/program manager who was less technical, was taking my product report and altering it prior to delivery to the vendor because she thought that it was too technical. I mentioned that the vendor was technical and needed more detail to understand our intent and not just our requirement since we've seen them in the past hit the requirement but miss the mark for usefulness in our environment. The vendor in the work program was building software for the broader community and not just us. The vendor could deliver software to the letter of the requirement, but not fulfil our business needs, impacting our decision to purchase the software. The program lead was used to and preferred high-level PowerPoint style bullet points, so my guidance was overruled. This was frustrating because I figured that this would come back to bite us, but I expressed my thoughts and then followed my supervisor's lead. After a couple of phase deliveries, it began to become clear to my lead that the vendor's product while innovative, wouldn't be able to be used; for instance we could search resources but couldn't filter based on metadata so sharing which was one of our yearly objectives would be impacted when dealing with classification and shared only new or updated content since the last time we shared. I once again expressed my concerns during a phase acceptance test. This time my supervisor and the agency CIO established a design meeting (one on one instead of the community) where I was able to go over major business needs and convey why some current designs wouldn't work for us. The agency CIO liked what I presented and found funds to extend the vendor's work program end date to incorporate my feedback. The product was eventually evaluated and purchased.

								Balancing schedules and tasks for Graham's back office and my client duties was a challenge that I was able to overcome. I loved the ability to remain hands-on with technology while supporting the customer and continuing to progress my career as a leader and executive for Graham. However, balancing the two became a challenge due to the multiple people with whom I was committed to providing solutions that didn't communicate with one another. I had my government supervisor and the other government leads tasking me on client site, my Graham supervisor the CEO, and other back office staff such as HR with recruiting and with customer outreach and proposal efforts. I was initially overwhelmed and because I could, I deliveered for may many customers. To create better balance, I opened lines of communications and began reporting relevant requests and what I believed were my priorities to each requester online. This was easy to manage and helped to other to realize that a need for additional resources for certain areas. Now I'm able to still make an impact, but my services are requested for the highly visible and key back office items, and my customer has begun funneling requests from multiple lead through my supervisor.

								Leidos Reporting: At the time I was young in my career. A more senior staff member was debating another team member about approaches to designing and implementing the business process modeling notation; even though that wasn't his area of expertise. I was young and inexperienced buthad some experience with BPMN. I spoke up and offered my advice which was contrary to the senior staff member. The senior staff member shut me down quickly and harshly in front of everyone. I respectfully persisted and he shut me down again dismissively. We proceed with the senior members recommendation. His design was later determined during implementation to be flawed. He later came back to me and apologized, stating that he would be more open to other ideas next time and vowed to never do that again. 

								</br></br>Church - A/V Team: Lead Pastor wanted TV quality live stream and had grand visions, but wouldn't take the time to understand the implications of his request; instead just criticized the production each week. I was originally working with another member of the senior staff to convey expectations of their predominantly free setup and what would be needed to improve various areas. I don't believe that knowledge was being passed and I didn't want to challenge the pastor in front of his senior leaders, so I decided to CC him on some of my discussions with two of the senior leaders for managing the website, social media stream, and in-house presentation. I presented cost and current functionality. It was discoveered that leadership thought that we didn't have some capability, but they discoveered that we did have the capability, but that there were other concerns as to why those capabilities weren't being used (song copyright, computer capacity, cost and software complexity). I also worked with leadership to identify other churches that had a setup that they felt was adequate and then worked with them to identify all that went into that setup (man power, tech setup, cost, pre-service preparation). This additional communication seemed to stem the tide of frustration and we were able to systematically work to improve the A/V setup in increments given our limited resources (volunteers, hand built computer, free streaming software).

								</br></br>Graham IR&D solution timeline: My Graham CEO is Bias for Action. He wanted results. For our IR&D work where our staff was primarily made up of interns and part time consultants, Mr. Graham expected solution turnaround time that he'd been accustomed to when he was on client site or based on the RFP on-ramp time lines that he saw. Due to the team make-up, I operated monthly sprints and he wanted 2 week sprints. Anticipating challenges, I delicately set expectations over time by conveying the considerations that went into my planning and why I recommended a certain cadence; such as the part time help with non-consistent schedules making determining velocity difficult, and the innovation that we were working on which was novel. Besides the Sprint Reviews, I also worked hard to get him in more backlog refinement meetings so that he could set priorities and see the complexities listed by the team for the Sprint Backlog items. This approach worked well and my supervisor either accepted the additional time requests, provided funds for me to outsource or bring on additional consultants, or worked with me to cut down his requirements.    

								</br></br>NVTC TONS Developer: I was too defensive. I expressed that I was passionate about seeing this goal through and didn't want him to feel as though I was attacking him, but instead giving him constructive criticism about what I felt were flaws in his software. We discussed it and worked together fine afterwards.

								I have studied the 14 Amazon leadership principles in detail to make sure I can perform all of them as required by the position, and because I generally agree with all of them. I've created an elaborate spreadsheet to map past performance and rate myself within each leadership category. I rated myself highly in categories such as customer obsession, bias for action, and backbone. Of those, customer obsession stands out to me. Customer obsession mapped to more past performance that the other principles and I have been consistent with this in every role I have undertaken so far. This is evidenced by me being known as Mr. Workaround with NVTC, because I'm always in search of and implementing ways to maintain a streamlined customer experience, while searching for a more permanent solution.

								Graham IR&D SME Redirection: Leading experienced consultants at time on my IR&D staff is challenging. There are times when I had to redirect the SMEs focus as they wanted to explore or implement tech that veered too far from our Sprint's narrative. During tag-ups there would be light debates about the direction and at times I'd have to shutdown an idea and give different direction. For instance, a data scientist had a desire to research and build a real AI model, however, the goal of this sprint was to prove out concepts using dummy data to hook in the middle and front tiers. i had to clearly state that he wasn't too continue that path because it risked missing the deadline and there were other team members that were dependent on him completing his portion and providing endpoints.

								</br></br>Bullying: I would certainly take some form of action. Bullying or harassment should never be tolerated in the workplace. I would make sure that the actions is in violation of company policy before taking official action. However, in the moment, I would do all that I could to stop what I feel is inappropriate behavior. That could include telling both parties that I feel that the situation is inappropriate for the workplace, or even inform a senior manager or HR. My goal wouldn't be to seem confrontational and escalate the situation, but to make sure that the 'bully' is aware that someone thinks that what they are doing is wrong, and the  bully know that they have support in case they want to speak up. I have been in a position with Leidos when a person was making inappropriate remarks of a sexual nature at work in front of a female co-worker. I could tell that it was said as a joke, but the comment was made to tell the female that he would be open to a similar work encounter. The female laughed it off, but I said 'be careful or you're going to catch a harassment case'. I said it half-jokingly with the hopes that I wouldn't escalate anything, but at the same time point out that his statement could be taken as an offense.

As a leader, I would always ensure the team I am leading feel inspired and motivated to be the absolute best they can for themselves and most importantly the customer.

								Graham IR&D Agile Solutions. As a part my annual objectives and key results, I'm tasked to deliver a certain number of IR&D capabilities. For each identified capability I update the team roadmap, and the capabilities are further broken down to user stories and tasks. I shape the team by adding and trimming interns, overhead staff, temporary consultants, and outsourced work. I train staff on processes and expectations. I coordinate backlog refinement by working with the product owner to prioritize stories and working with the team to scope stories and tasks. From the high priority product backlog items, I work with the team to establish a sprint backlog. I use the sprint backlog to lead the team through a sprint where we deliver a product increment.

								Graham IR&D backlog: Team wasn't going into Jira and maintaining their tasks, user stories, and associated Confluence documentation as well as I'd hoped. Instead of capturing user stories in the backlog and adding tasks suggestions within the description area of the US, I refined the backlog to include tasks below user stories. Then, the team could add more tasks, but we could easily see what needed to be done to achieve a user story or capability within the roadmap. We dragged tasks to the sprint backlog and only moved the user story up when the associated tasks were completed. This improved progress of my team as they were able to see what needed to be done easier and helped me with assigning and tracking work.

I'd spent may year developing solutions and interfacing with clients to engineer and deliver solutions, however, prior to Graham, I didn't have much experience with business development, capture and proposal management. I was up for the challenge to grow beyond the technical domain. I attended courses and worked with a mentor to get up to speed. I learned how to identify a portfolio of qualified leads for the company to pursue, help with what to offer and present a winning proposal, and close a sale by producing and presenting document and technology. I was able to stretch myself and enhance my experience.
